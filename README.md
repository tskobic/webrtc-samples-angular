# WebRTC Samples Angular

Angular 15 application built following the [WebRTC Code Samples repository](https://github.com/webrtc/samples). This application uses Angular Material, implements 5-1 SCSS Pattern architecture and Angular modules lazy-loading. To insulate the app from WebRTC browsers incompatibilities, [adapter.js](https://github.com/webrtchacks/adapter) is being used.

The app is currently being worked on because not all code samples have been implemented yet.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
